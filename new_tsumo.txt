Zvikoni zvikoni, mimba haibve negosoro.
Akuruma nzeve ndewako.
Chaitemura chavakuseva.
Chinobhururuka chinomhara.
Chirere chigokurerawo.
Charova sei chando chakwidza hamba mumuti.
Mwoyo muti unomera paunoda.
Chidamwoyo hamba yakada makwati.
Chinono chinengwe, bere rakadya richifamba.
Chinoziva ivhu kuti mwana wembeva anorwara.
Chiri mumwoyo chiri muninga.
Murombo haarove chinenguwo.
Kakara kununa hudya kamwe.
Kandiro kanoenda kunobva kamwe. 
Kuipa kuipa haro bveni, asi haridyi chakafa choga.
Kuudza mwana hupedzisira.
Kuziva mbuya huudzwa.
Mandikururumidze akazvara mandinonoke.
Matakadya kare haanyaradzi mwana.
Mazvokuda mavanga enyora.
Muroyi royera kure vekwako vagokureverera.
Mwana wamambo muranda kumwe.
Mviromviro dzemhanza mapfeka.
Mombe yekurunzirwa ndeyekukama wakarinda nzira.
Mwana asingachemi anofira mumbereko.
Takabva nako kumhunga hakuna ipwa.
Nzou hairemerwi nenyanga dzayo.
Pfavira ngoma, husiku hurefu.
Ndamba kuudzwa akaonekwa nembonje pahuma.
Seka urema wafa.
Yadeuka yadeuka mvura yemuguchu haidyorerwi.
Yatsika dope yanwa.
Zano ndega akasiya jira mumasese.
Zingizi gonyera pamwe, maruva enyika haaperi.
Kure kwegava ndiko kusina mutsubvu.
Totenda maruva tadya chakata.
Kurera imbwa nemukaka mangwana inofuma yokuruma.
Kwadzinorohwa matumbu ndiko kwadzinomhanyira.
Vataitururira matohwe nhasi ndivo votiseka maparapadzwa.
Chigarisano ndicho chine mhosva.
Mugoni wepwere ndiye asinayo.
